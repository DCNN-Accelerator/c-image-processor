Pseudocode for C-based Image Parser 

Goals:
- Send serial image data to FPGA via UART
- Unpack 4096x4096x3 Image into UART serial stream
- Handshake with FPGA for functionally correct data delivery 
- UART Module for Data transfer
- Receive convolved data from FPGA
- Re-stitch image into proper dimensions


High-Level Function Descriptions: 

//Pre FPGA Modules
- Load_Image()
   - Take image file and load it into a proper C array or equivalent data type 
   - (maybe CV2 based library for C? - ask Dr.P) 
   
- Image_PreProc() //in case image preprocessing is needed for data
    - TODO: Determine wether image needs to be preprocessed prior to serial transmission
    
- Kernel_PreProc()
    - TODO: Kernel needs to be normalized to 8-bit integers for faster FPGA processing
- Image_to_Serial()
    - Unpack C-based image into serial stream ready for UART Transmission

//Data Transfer 
- UART_MASTER() 
   -TODO: Research C-based UART libraries

//Recieve Data 
Image_Restitch() 
   - Recieve data from FPGA UART line and re-pack into C-array
